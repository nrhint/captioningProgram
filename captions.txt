Hello My name is Elder Hinton
I am a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day saints
What do I do?
Well I am glad you asked.
Me and my friend here love to talk about Jesus Christ
We are always ready to share a message about him and to help you have a better day
So, if you are ever feeling down or want to connect with God, give us a call.
Oh and did we mention that we do free service!
We love to help people out at no cost. You don't even have to listen to us if you don't want to.
Well we have to go but if you ever need anything let us know!
