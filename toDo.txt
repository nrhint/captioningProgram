Easy:
 - Make the program look for specific file on startup instead of having the user enter the name
 - Change the program so that the line of text shows before you press the 't' key
 - Have a start message print when the 'g' key is pressed
 - Add an advanced options in the menu for changing the cc length or other things
 - make a config file
   - change the verbosity of the output
   - change if there is a default file to look for
   - default ccLength
   - default pos and size of captions
   - default rotation?
Medium:
 - Make an auto update function
 - Make a option to shift the captions in time
 - change the output format to have either SRT or VTT captions
Hard:
 - Make the program open up the video inside of itself.
 - make the program burn in the captions if the user wants that

Plan:
 - add to and use the config file
 - change the menu to be in a differnt file
 - build the auto update function
