# captioningVideos
This repository contains a program that makes captions from a text file for a video based on timestamps from keypresses on the keyboard.

<h1>Installing:</h1>
This will use python. Click <a href = 'https://www.python.org/downloads/'>this link</a> and download python. After it downloads install the program and continue on.

<h1>Using</h1>

After installing python double click on the runMe.py file then it will open up and give you instructions to run the program. If you mess up at any time you can press 'r' and it will go back to the start and you can try to caption the video again.

<h1>Extra features and information</h1>

This is all you need if you only want to generate the captions. You can upload the .srt file to facebook if you want. To burn them into your video which is recommended for social media you will also need to download and install <a href = 'https://handbrake.fr/downloads.php'>handbrake</a> which can add your captions without losing too much video quality. Every time you edit your video it wil lose some quality but for me the quality change was not noticeable and it does a very good job at burning in the captions.

<h1>To do:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Make the video play in the python window using opencv. You can also capture keypresses in this way so you would not need the pynput library any more.
  <li>Make the program burn in the captions if you want them too. Eliminate the need for handbrake
</ul>
